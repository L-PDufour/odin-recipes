  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    These BBQ Beef and Beans are like the love child of baked beans and beef chili.
  </p>
  <p>
    They’re hearty and flavorful, they meal prep well, and can be as no-fuss or as “from scratch” as you want them to
    be. I’ve included instructions to make them vegetarian or to amp up the vegetable content below, so scroll on down
    to see more!
